# Research-on-grasping-planning-of-mobile-robot-arm-based-on-deep-reinforcement-learning
Project Overview
This project is based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) methods, combined with the improved TD3 algorithm (including TD3, TD3(GRU), TD3(LSTM), and TD3(GRU)_PER versions), to implement dynamic obstacle avoidance and target grasping planning for a mobile robotic arm in complex environments. By introducing COQNLS, GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit), LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), and Prioritized Experience Replay (PER) mechanisms, the performance and convergence efficiency of the model are significantly enhanced.

Project Structure
The project code is organized into the following six major components:
1. Environment Code
These files simulate the robot's movement and task execution in a dynamic environment, handling interactions between the robot, obstacles, and target objects.
Files: Dynamic_env_1.py to Dynamic_env_7.py, with the final training environment being Dynamic_env_6_double_obstacle_关键预测.py.
Description: These environment files define different versions of the environment model, ranging from Dynamic_env_1.py to Dynamic_env_7.py. Each version includes dynamic obstacles and target grasping tasks. The environment used in the final experiments is Dynamic_env_6_double_obstacle_关键预测.py.

2. Algorithm Code
This section contains the deep reinforcement learning algorithms used to train the robot, covering various versions of the TD3 algorithm.
Files: TD3.py, TD3(GRU).py, TD3(LSTM).py, TD3(GRU)_PER.py
Description: These files implement different versions of the TD3 algorithm:
TD3: The classic TD3 algorithm based on the Actor-Critic model, using two Critic networks to improve stability.
TD3(GRU): Integrates GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) into TD3 to handle sequential decision-making, especially suitable for dynamic environments.
TD3(LSTM): Integrates LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) into TD3 to compare the dynamic obstacle avoidance ability of TD3(GRU) and enhance the model's capacity to handle long-term dependencies.
TD3(GRU)_PER: Enhances TD3(GRU) by incorporating Prioritized Experience Replay (PER), improving sample efficiency.

3. Training Code
This code is responsible for managing and executing the training process, including different versions of the TD3 algorithm.
Files: TD3_train.py, TD3(GRU)_train.py, TD3(LSTM)_train.py, TD3(GRU)_PER_train.py
Description: These training scripts are used for training different versions of the TD3 algorithm:
TD3_train.py: For training the standard TD3 algorithm.

4. Noise Code
This code enhances the exploration process during training, particularly in continuous action spaces, to avoid the policy from getting stuck in local optima.
Files: Normal_Ounoise.py
Description: This file implements OU noise (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck noise) and Gaussian noise, adding noise to the action selection process to promote exploration in the environment.

5. Inverse Kinematics Optimization Code
This code computes the inverse kinematics for the mobile robot arm, optimizing the approximate grasping posture as expert guidance, ensuring that the robot can accurately grasp the target. Key steps include:
Forward Kinematics: Given joint angles, the position of the robot's end effector is calculated.
